# nfb—dev notes

1. write input text (description of a visual prompt)
2. feed text to the python bot through irc chat
3. process received text and break it down into smaller units, to analyse its semantics, grammar and structure (eg, check sentences’ lengths, how many times commas and semicolons are being used in a sentence, how many adjective, etc)
4. use the above analysis to configure the bot

1. human users prepare input texts, which is processed w/
	* [natural language kit](http://www.nltk.org)
	* [wit.ai](https://wit.ai)
2. irc-bot is created based on the above input text, and starts talking w/ human users of another group:
	* [sopel.chat](https://sopel.chat)
	* [skybot](https://github.com/rmmh/skybot)
	* [chatterbot](http://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
3. ~ looping between the two parties until the human user group figure out what the description that was fed to the bot to set its parameters looks like

Can’t i just feed the text to the chatbot parser to start giving it qualitative data? 

Analysing the text would be useful if then I can use the data to setup the chatbot thing: like producing a `config.json` out of the input text to then use to setup the chabot parameters, but I suspect this intermediate passage is not necessary at all for the chatbot to work.
