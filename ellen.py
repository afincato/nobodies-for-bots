'The programmer, who needs clarity, who must talk all day to a machine that demands declarations, hunkers down into a low-grade annoyance.',
'It is here that the stereotype of the programmer, sitting in a dim room, growling from behind Coke cans, has its origins.',
'The disorder of the desk, the floor; the yellow Post-it notes everywhere; the whiteboards covered with scrawl: all this is the outward manifestation of the messiness of human thought.',
'The messiness cannot go into the program; it piles up around the programmer.',

'Soon the programmer has no choice but to retreat into some private interior space, closer to the machine, where things can be accomplished.',
'The machine begins to seem friendlier than the analysts, the users, the managers. The real-world reflection of the program — who cares anymore?',
'Guide an x-ray machine or target a missile; print a budget or a dossier; run a city subway or a disk-drive read/write arm: it all begins to blur.',
'The system has crossed the membrane — the great filter of logic, instruction by instruction — where it has been cleansed of its linkages to actual human life.',

'The goal now is not whatever all the analysts first set out to do; the goal becomes the creation of the system itself.',
'Any ethics or morals or second thoughts, any questions or muddles or exceptions, all dissolve into a junky Nike-mind: Just do it.',
'If I just sit here and code, you think, I can make something run.',
'When the humans come back to talk changes, I can just run the program.',
'Show them: Here. Look at this. See? This is not just talk. This runs.',
'Whatever you might say, whatever the consequences, all you have are words and what I have is this, this thing I’ve built, this operational system.',
'Talk all you want, but this thing here: it works.'
